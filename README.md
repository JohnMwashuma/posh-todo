# Todo

This is a Todo application using
[Posh](https://github.com/mpdairy/posh), a library that lets you
easily use a DataScript database to keep your entire app state.

This Todo app lets you add or delete tasks to different categories and
view by checked/unchecked or by category.

There's no styling and it's a really lame todo list, but I made it
just to show an example of how to use Posh.

You can see posh-todo in action here: http://otherway.org/posh-todo/

## Usage

Clone it, then

```
lein run -m clojure.main script/figwheel.clj
```

Then go here in your browser:

```
http://localhost:3449/
```
## Some nice components

### Checkbox

If you have an entity with a boolean value that you want the user to
be able to change, just load this component with the `id` and `attr`
of the entity.

```clj
(defn checkbox [conn id attr checked?]
  [:input
      {:type "checkbox"
       :checked checked?
       :onChange #(p/transact! conn [[:db/add id attr (not checked?)]])}])
```

The component above would be called from another component that loads
the entity and supplies the `checked?` value of the `attr`.

If you wanted a standalone checkbox, you could query within the
component:

```clj
(defn checkbox [conn id attr]
  (let [checked? (attr @(p/pull conn [attr] id))]
    [:input
     {:type "checkbox"
      :checked checked?
      :onChange #(p/transact! conn [[:db/add id attr (not checked?)]])}]))
```

### Add Box

This component loads a text input with an add button that calls the
callback function with the value of the text box  whenever the add
button is clicked. It uses a local reagent atom to update the text
box.

```clj
(defn add-box [add-fn]
  (let [edit (r/atom "")]
    (fn [add-fn]
      [:span
       [:input
        {:type "text"
         :value @edit
         :onChange #(reset! edit (-> % .-target .-value))}]
       [:button
        {:onClick #(when-not (empty? @edit)
                     (add-fn @edit)
                     (reset! edit ""))}
                     (or (:button-text options) "Add")]])))
```

The add-fn would be something like `(partial add-task! conn
category-id)` where `add-task!` is:

```clj
(defn add-task!
  [conn category-id task-name]
  (util/new-entity! conn {:task/name task-name
                          :task/category category-id
                          :task/done false}))
```

This adds a new task to a category in the todo.
